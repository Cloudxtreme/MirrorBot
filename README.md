## MirrorBot

MirrorBot is a Facebook Messenger bot for learning about Web-Developer events in an interactive way.
MirrorBot is currently in early Alpha.

MirrorBot is built using [node](http://nodejs.org/en/), [express](http://expressjs.com/) and the [Facebook Messenger API](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform).

It is currently being hosted on Heroku, so response times can be a little slow.
